Hello World Repository Introduction to GitHub

An IT Officer / Systems Administrator with a programming background on SAP-ABAP. 
I am looking forward to explore the various programming languages. 
I believe that one programming language cannot solve all problems, therefore I am on the journey to explore the various problems, find the most appropriate programming language to solve that problem, learn it and code it.
